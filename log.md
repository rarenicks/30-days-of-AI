# 30 Days Of AI code challenge - Log 

### Day 0: May 31, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Created this repo for tracking my daily progress, will maintain this log.md file to journal the updates.
Also, created a new kernel for anaconda jupyter for exploiting GPU using tensorflow. 

**Motivation:**  Always wanted to add discipline into my learnings and work to boost my productivity in the long run.
However, in any timeboxed event, I often find myself sleeping in the first lap, crawling in the second, running in third and finally sprinting in the last quater 
to get the things done. As I have practiced this habit over years, so most of the time 
I complete the work successfully but at the cost of screwed up sleep cycles and metal peace in the end.

So, that's the main motivation of this challenge to not just organize my work pattern but to add consistency and discipline into it, so that I can just jog in the all four
quarters of the race and complete it with joy and mental peace. However, I acknowledge this will be challenging
and I may or maynot be able to complete this challenge but atleast its a good start in right direction, and I feel motivated and happy
to kick off this challenge from June 01, 2021 :)
